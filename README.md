# ASL to English Alphabet Translator

Seeing the lack of ASL to English Translators available online, we decided to start this project.
Using OpenCV to process video, and MediaPipe to track hand gestures (using landmark coordinates), we aim to first, effectively and accurately translate ASL to the English Alphabet.

## Goal
While currently still a little buggy and incomplete, the finished project will be be used to help people learn ASL Gestures by practicing on the web.

## Upcoming Features
Once we've finished mapping more ASL Gestures, we intend to implement the translator on a webpage, to facilitate easier access. This will be done via a Flask backend, and HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend.
